# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
Project Overview

The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning. This project aims to build models that predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features like age, sex, passenger class, and more.

Key Objectives:

Handle missing values and categorical data.

Apply feature scaling, encoding, and selection.

Train multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVC, KNN).

Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

ðŸ›  Technologies & Libraries

Python,NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn (for ML models, preprocessing, feature selection)

TensorFlow (optional, if using neural networks)

Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ”‘Features

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Feature scaling and encoding

Feature selection using SelectKBest and RFECV

Multiple ML models with hyperparameter tuning

Model evaluation with confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

ðŸ“ˆ Example Output

Accuracy and metrics for each model

Confusion matrix visualizations

Insights into which features are most important

ðŸ’¡ Why This Matters

The Titanic dataset is widely used for learning machine learning concepts. By completing this project, you gain practical experience in:

Data preprocessing

Model selection and evaluation

Working with multiple ML algorithms in Python

ðŸ“Œ Optional Extensions

Create a Streamlit web app to allow users to input passenger info and predict survival interactively.

Compare more advanced ML models or ensembles
